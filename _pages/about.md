I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institut Jean-Le-Rond-d'Alembert](http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/ijlrda/), a large laboratory of the [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://goo.gl/maps/DNvQgSaevBBmWtos7) in Paris, France, since July 2022. Under the supervision of [Taraneh Sayadi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Taraneh-Sayadi) and in collaboration with [Vincent Le Chenadec](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent-Le-Chenadec), [Frederic Nataf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederic-Nataf) and [Pierre Fortin](), we are developing [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages for Krylov solvers preconditioners based on multi-level Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM).

Back in April 2022, I defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled [Instabilities and Transition to Turbulence in Periodic Flows
](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362536309_Instabilities_and_transition_to_turbulence_in_periodic_flows)." This work was done under the joint supervision of [Jean-Christophe Loiseau](https://loiseaujc.github.io/) and [Jean-Christophe Robinet](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=xlpB1PIAAAAJ&hl=fr). The core of my work lies in the development and implementation of Newton-Krylov and eigenvalue solvers for large systems such as discrete Navier-Stokes equations. The results are available in [nekStab](https://github.com/nekStab), our in-house toolbox for large-scale stability analysis in [Nek5000](https://github.com/Nek5000). I have been working with dynamical systems theory to address the transition to turbulence in time-periodic flows using Floquet stability analysis of fully 3D flows.

Research Activity
======

Transition to turbulence : Transition to turbulence is one of the most important unsolved problem in fluid dynamics. From an engineering point of view, turbulence may be beneficial (e.g. in mixing problems) or detrimental (e.g. in aerodynamics applications). In either case, a better understanding of the physical mechanisms causing the flow to transition to turbulence is needed. This increased understanding may then be used to try to promote or delay transition. In this context, part of my research is dedicated to understanding these mechanisms and predicting the onset of turbulence by using tools from dynamical system theory. In particular, we develop large-scale Newton-Krylov and eigenvalue solvers to perform stability analyses of fully three-dimensional flow configurations. This work has recently culminated in the development of nekStab, a user-friendly toolbox for the spectral element solver Nek5000. This toolbox will be released as open-source very shortly.
